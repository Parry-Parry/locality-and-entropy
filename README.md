# Disentangling Locality and Entropy in Ranking Distillation

## Structure
* Data and Training is provided in the implicit package
* The paper directory provides several scripts for empirical measures of variables
* The tables directory shows how tables were generated (with some aesthetic changes in latex)
* The scripts directory shows how all models were trained for this work, all training settings are either default within the associated train_cat / train_dot python file or specified in a bash script.
